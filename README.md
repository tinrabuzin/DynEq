# DynEq - A Python module for identification and uncertainty analysis of dynamic models

This module can be used to identify parameters of dynamic models and perform uncertainty analysis of the model outputs. 

It also contains interfaces for the models in PowerFactory and OpenModelica where the equivalent models of distribution networks were implemented. The module was developed during my thesis work and largely used in the following paper: 
T. Rabuzin, R. Eriksson and L. Nordstr√∂m, "[Model Structure Selection and Validation for Dynamic Equivalencing of Distribution Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9650613)," in IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, vol. 13, no. 2, pp. 1347-1356, March 2022, doi: 10.1109/TSG.2021.3135293.
